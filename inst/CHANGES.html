This file reports the most recent updates, changes and enhancements made
to the packages included in the Rmetrics environment. The packages are:

fBasics, fCalendar, fSeries, fMultivar, fExtremes, fOptions, fPortfolio


________________________________________________________________________________ 
Rmetrics VERSION 220.10063
Rmetrics VERSION 211.10062

2005-11-02
	This is a preliminary version with smaller modifications, updates, and
	additions compared to Rmetrics 201.0061.
	
	Not yet updated is the documentation included in DocFactSheet.pdf
	Doc, DocRefcard.pdf, and DocRmetrics.pdf. These documents have Version
	211.10062. This update is under progress.
	
	The major effort was invested to make under both environments MS Windows  
	and Linux Rmetrics running based on the new compiler suite with
	gfortran. Please note, that I have done this move for Rmetrics already 
	under MS Windows, although this is not yet done for R. The reason why
	I have done this, is that I develop under MS Windows, and that I wan't
	support two systems based on different compiler suites. The Mac Version
	is not yet tested, but hopefully it will run.

2005-04-28 fCalendar: C1-timeSeriesClass
    The time Series class got a new slot named "@recordIDs". The
    slot is represented by a data.frame whcih can be used for
    data record identification. This may be useful for FX data
    sets to name the contributor, to keep delays from the feed
    or other information. For Futures this may for example name
    the futures contract.
    
2005-04-28 fCalendar: C1-timeSeriesClass
    The arguments named "colNames" have been changed to "units", 
    so that the naming of columns becomes unique in all 'timeSeries'
    functions. Some time series functions got an additional

    The portfolio package has been started. Topics about multivariate
    distributions, assets modelling, drawdown statistics, value-at-risk
    modelling, Markowitz portfolio, two assets portfolio and data sets
    have been added.
    
2005-03-21 fPortfolio: A1-MultivariateDistribution
    This is a collection and description of functions to compute 
    multivariate densities and probabilities from skew normal and 
    skew Student-t distribution functions. Furthermore, multivariate 
    random daviates can be generated, and for multivariate data, 
    the parameters of the underlying distribution can be estimated 
    by the maximum log-likelihood estimation.
    
2005-03-20 fPortfolio: A2-AssetsModelling
    This is a collection and description of functions which generate 
    multivariate artficial data sets of assets, which fit the parameters 
    to a multivariate normal, skew normal, or (skew) Student-t distribution
    and which compute some benchmark statistics. In addition a function
    is provided which allows for the selection and clustering of individual
    assets from portfolios using hierarchical and k-means clustering
    approaches.
    
2005-03-19 fPortfolio: A3-DrawdownStatistics

    Value-at-Risk and related risk measures for a portfolio of assets. 
    In addition utility functions are available to compute the maximum 
    loss, to calculate the total return, and to plot a histogram of
    the total return.
    
2005-03-17 fPortfolio: B2-MarkowitzPortfolio
    This is a collection and description of functions which investigate 
    the efficient frontier for a Markowitz portfolio from a given return 
    series \code{x} in the mean-variance sense when short selling is 
    forbidden. Tangency, equal weigths, and Monte Carlo portfolios can 
    also be evaluated.
    
2005-03-14 fPortfolio: B3-TwoAssetsPortfolio
    This is a collection and description of functions which investigate 
    the efficient frontier for a two assets portfolio from a given return

    is forbidden. 
    
2005-03-12 fSeries: A1-ArmaModelling
    Two new functions have been added. "armaToeplitz" allows to compute
    the covariance matrix from autocovariances, and "armaFischer"
    computes the Fischer information matrix for an ARMA time series
    process. 

2005-03-03 fMultivar: X1-MultivarData
    Four new data sets have been added for the examples: 'CobbDouglas' and
    'logCobbDouglas' data for the Cobb-Douglas productivity function as
    used in exaple 7.10 in the book of D.N. Gujarati; 'Greene4Table131'
    US yearly investment data as listed in the book of W. Greene, 'pr45'

    D.L. Rubinfeld.
    
2005-03-02 fMultivar: B1-MatrixAddon
    Functions vec and vech have been added, that stack a matrix and the 
    lower triangle matrix.
    
2005-03-02 fBasics: HyperbolicDistribution
    Functions for the computation of the generalized hyperbolic distribution
    have been added: dgh, pgh, qgh, and rgh.

2005-02-28 fSeries: GarchDistributions
    The three chapters C2-SkewNormalDistribution, C2-SkewNormalDistribution,
    C2-SkewGedDistribution have been merged to one, named C2-GarchDistributions.
    C5-GarchDistributionFits has thus been renamed to C5-GarchDistributionFits.

2005-01-22 fBasics: HyperbolicDistribution
    Functions to compute probability, density, quantiles and to generate
    random deviates in 2nd, 3rd and 4th parameterization for the hyperbolic
    distribution have been added. Furthermore, functions have been 
    implemented to compute the hyperbolic mode in all four parameterizations.
    
2005-01-21 fBasics: StableDistribution
    Functions to compute probability, density, quantiles and to generate
    random deviates in "S1" and "S2" parameterizations for the stable
    distribution have been added. Furthermore, afunction have been 
    implemented to compute the stable mode.
    
2004-12-12 fMultivar: MatrixAddon
    A function to compute the exponential of a square matrix has been
    added.

2004-11-17 fSeries: fMultivar
    The package 'fSeries' has become too "fat", so I partitioned it into
    twp parts: 'fSeries' and 'fMultivar'. The first part now holds functions
    for the analysis of time series including ARMA Modelling, GARCH
    Modelling and Hypothesis Testing, the second part holds now functions
    for time series anlaysis with regression methods and functions
    for the technical anlaysis including rolling analysis and benchmarks.
      
2004-11-16 fBasics: B4-ClassicalTests/B5-StylizedFacts
    The script file "B4-ClassicalTests" has become too big, so we divided
    them into three new parts named "B4-TestsClass", "B5-OneSampleTests",
    and "B6-TwoSampleTests". The script file "B5-StylizedFacts" has been 
    renamed "B7-StylizedFacts". This information is given for those who 
    are interested in the source code and internal structure of the Rmetrics 
    packages.
 
2004-11-14 fBasics: ClassicalTests
    We made some changes on the classical test functions. We have 
    introduced an S4 object of class "fHTEST" which describes the
    classical tests, we have added the usual arguments "title" and
    "description" to the argument list, and the output of the test
    now gives more information than the typical printing of R's S3 
    object "htest".
    
2004-11-13 fBasics: SPlusCompatibility
    These are R functions which we made available for SPlus, including 
    - General Functions: strsplit, match.fun, cov, forwardsolve, %x%, 
      data, NROW, NCOL, sd, nlm, optim, download.file.
    - Tests: bartlett.test, fligner.test, kruskal.test.    
    These functions may be helpful for porting Rmetrics functions
    to SPlus.    

2004-11-11 fSeries: garchSim
    The function "garchSim" was not working properly when not all model
    parameters where explicitely specified in the argument list.
    Missing parameters are now added correctly. [Note, that the "garch" 
    functions will be replaced soon by a new completely rewritten 
    package in the near future.]

2004-10-29 fExtremes: gpdFit
    The residual statistics and the information about threshold value
    and the number of exceedances have been added to the summary report. 
    Now, beside numeric vectors also univariate time series objects 
    are accepted as input arguments.
    
2004-10-29 fExtremes: MdaPlots
    Now, beside numeric vectors also univariate time series objects 
    are accepted as input arguments.

2004-10-29 fExtremes: gevFit
    The residual statistics has been added to the summary report. 
    Now, beside numeric vectors also univariate time series objects 
    are accepted as input arguments.
    
2004-10-29 fExtremes: gevglmFit
    The residual statistics has been added to the summary report.
    Now, beside numeric vectors also univariate time series objects 
    are accepted as input arguments.
    
2004-10-27 fExtremes: data/*
    The "bmw", "danish" and "siemens" data are now 2 column data frame 
    objects with the first column as ISO-8601 character dates %Y-%m-%d 
    and the second column as numeric values. Formerly they were numeric
    vectors with POSIX date attributes. Now these data records can 
    easily be transformed to 'timeSeries' objects and used in the same
    way as under SPlus.

2004-10-16 fOptions: xmpfOptions
    Bug removed. Internal function 'readf.fOptions00Index' corrected
    as '.readf.fOptions00Index'. Now the fOptions examples should work.

2004-10-16 fOptions: BesselFunctions
    Modified Bessel Functions of the first and second kind for integer
    order together with their derivatives have been added. The functions
    are entirely written in S.

2004-10-14 fOptions: EBMDistribution
    Examples have been added to the help file. In addition a bug was
    fixed: An internal used variable for the computation of the second 
    derivative of the reciprocal Gamma and Johnson Type I distribution
    was missing.
   
    + many other smaller improvements and fixings ...
    
________________________________________________________________________________

    The new version is now proofed to be conform with R Version 2.0 for
    all its functions.

2004-10-03 fSeries: ArmaStatistics
    The functions from the "ArmaStatisticts" collection have been merged
    with the collection of "ArmaModelling" functions.
    
2004-10-01 Rmetrics:
    The naming of the source and manual page files follows now a unique
    naming convention.
    
2004-09-27 fSeries: demo/funSeries
    Three new functions have been added to the "funSeries.R" file in the
    demo directory: "tslag" - computes lagged or leading vector/matrix 
    of selected order(s), "pdl" - creates a regressor matrix for 
    polynomial distributed lags, and "disaggregate" - disaggregates 
    a vector or time series from low to high frequency.

2004-09-21 fBasics: BasicStatistics
    All column and row statistics functions now allow for 'timeSeries' 
    objects and any other 'rectangular' objects which can be transformed 
    to a matrix as input.

    and any other objects which can be transformed to a vector as input.
    
2004-09-19 fBasics: StylizedFacts
    All stylized facts functions now allow for univariate 'timeSeries' 
    objects and any other objects which can be transformed to a vector 
    as input.
    
2004-09-19 fBasics: ClassicalTests
    All test functions now allow for univariate 'timeSeries' objects and 
    any other objects which can be transformed to a vector as input.

2004-09-18 fOptions: EBMDistributions, GammaFunctions, HypergeometricFunctions
    Three new Chapters have been introduced with functions to compute
    distributions, the error, gamma and related functions, and the 
    confluent hypergeometric functions. These functions are useful in the
    field of Exponential Brownian Motion and for the valuation of 
    Asian Options. The demo file "demo/funOptions.R" where the functions 
    where originally listed is now obsolete.

2004-09-14 fSeries: UnitrootDistribution
    Two functions to compute the cumulative probability, punitroot, 
    and the quantiles, qunitroot, of the unit root test statistics 
    have been added. The functions are based on the Fortran routine 
    and the tables published by J.G. McKinnon 1988.
    
2004-09-10 fSeries: black.ts.csv
    A data file which contains real monthly stock return data from January  
    1978 to December 1987 which are constructed from Berndt's (1991) 
    data set have been added.
    
2004-09-10 fSeries: LongMemoryModelling
    Functions to simulate the long memory behaviour of an univariate 
    time series process have been added. Inclided are Beran's, 
    Durbin's, and Paxson's method to generate Fractional Gaussian
    Noise.

2004-09-08 fSeries: klein.csv
    A data file which contains data for Klein's (1950) simple econometric 
    model of the US economy has been added.
    
2004-09-08 fSeries: xmpZWChapter03
    Demo files with examples from Chapter 3 of the book of Zivot and
    Wang "Modeling Financial Time Series with Splus" have been added.

2004-09-03 fSeries: RollingAnalysis
    Caused by a typing error the function 'rollMean' failed when the 
    argument 'trim' was set to FALSE. This has been corrected.

2004-09-03 fSeries: EquationsModelling
    We have added functions to perform fits of systems of regression 
    equations. The underlying functions are those from the contributed 
    R-package 'systemfit' written by Jeff D. Hamann and Arne Henningsen.
    'systemfit' offers functions for fitting linear structural equations 
    using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Weighted Least Squares (WLS), 
    Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR), Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS), 
    Weighted Two-Stage Least Squares (W2SLS) or Three-Stage Least 
    Squares (3SLS). The wrapper fullfills the naming conventions of 
    Rmetrics, returns a S4 objects, and allows for 'timeSeries' objects 
    as input. In addition a S-Plus like Finmetrics function 'SUR' is 
    made available. 
    
2004-09-03 fSeries: xmpEqnsGreenfeld
    An example to estimate Grunfeld's Model Data with OLS and SUR was
    added. Different stock prices often move in the same direction at 
    a given point in time. The SUR technique may provide more efficient 
    estimates than OLS in this situation. The example was used by Zellner 
    in his classic. 1962 paper on seemingly unrelated regressions. 
   
2004-09-03 fSeries: kmenta.csv
    A data file which contains partly contrived data from Kmenta (1986) has
    been added, constructed to illustrate estimation of a simultaneous 
    equation models.
    
2004-09-02 fBasics: HolidayCalendars 
    The function 'fjulian' got a new argument 'swap' making the old
    one 'cc' obsolute. This change was inspired by the POSIX standard.
    'swap' is an integer value which determines when dates without
    the century specifications swap from the 19th to 20th century,
    by default the value is 20, i.e. we swap 1920.

2004-09-02 fBasics: WebImport
    A new function named 'fredImport' has been added which allows for 
    downloading daily financial market data from the St. Louis FED.
    The import functions got a new argument 'sep' which allows to
    specify the field separator in the data file, usually an Excel
    *.csv file. The default is a semicolon.

2004-08-05 fSeries: DESCRIPTION
    The package 'modreg' has been merged into 'stats', so we have
    removed it from the dependency list in the description file.
    This caused for Mac OSX operated system a failure.

2004-08-05 fSeries: surex1.ts.csv
    A data file has been added which contains monthly sampled exchange 
    rate spot returns and forward premium data ranging from March 1976 to 
    June 1996 for the following currencies: USD vs. CAD, DEM, FFR, ITL,
    JPY and GBP.  

2004-07-07 fSeries: nelsonplosser.csv
    The Nelson-Plosser data set containing the fourteen US economic time
    series used by Nelson and Plosser in their seminal paper has been added.
    
2004-07-07 fSeries: xmpAparchModelling
    The four demos "xmpAparchInnovations", "xmpAparchSimulation",
    "xmpAparchEstimation", and "xmpAparchNYSERES" have been merged
    to one new demo named "xmpAparchModelling" to reduce a little bit 
    the large number of example files.
    
2004-07-07 fSeries: xmpArmaModelling
    The two demos "xmpArmaAnalysis", and "xmpArmaModelling", have been
    merged to one new demo named "xmpArmaModelling" to reduce a little
    bit the large number of example files.
    
2004-07-07 fBasics: xmpImportInternet
    The three demos "xmpImportYahoo", "xmpImportEconomagics", and
    "xmpImportForecasts"  have been merged to one new demo named 
    "xmpImportInternet" to reduce a little bit the large number of 
    example files.
 
2004-07-07 fBasics: xmpXtsBusinessTime
